Thanks for contributing to H1 Theme (based on Underscores) â€” you rock!

## H1 Theme
Before getting started, make sure your issue has not been discussed earlier. Also of interest might be upstream tickets [here](https://github.com/Automattic/_s/search).

Here are some tips to consider and to help you write a great report:

* `_s` supports Internet Explorer 9 and greater, as well as the latest two versions of all other major browsers. In H1 Theme, our aim is to provide basic support for older browsers (such as IE 8) by using an automatically generated, media query-less stylesheet with px values instead of rems. This however doesn't remove the burden of making sure your css or JS otherwise works in older browsers.
* `_s` is backwards compatible with the two versions prior to the current stable version of WordPress.
* `_s` uses HTML5 markup. In HTML5, it is common to use multiple `<h1>` elements.
* H1 Theme includes a Finnish translation, but the terminology might not suit your particular project. Beware!
